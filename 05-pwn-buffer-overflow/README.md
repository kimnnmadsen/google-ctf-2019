# Description
## STOP GAN
Label: pwn

Success, you've gotten the picture of your lost love, not knowing that pictures and the things you take pictures of are generally two seperate things, you think you've rescue them and their brethren by downloading them all to your ships hard drive. They're still being eaten, but this is a fact that has escaped you entirely. Your thoughts swiftly shift to revenge. It's important now to stop this program from destroying these "Cauliflowers" as they're referred to, ever again.

# Solution
This attachment is a zip file containing a `bof` binary and a `console.c` source file. The description for the task also includes the text `buffer-overflow.ctfcompetition.com 1337`. Looking at the source file, we see that the binary `bof` is run using qemu and then we have to send input into that program and cause it to crash. There is also a bonus flag if we can cause a controlled crash. To test locally I just ran `qemu-mipsel bof` which runs the program and shows the prompt `Cauliflower systems never crash >>`. Entering text into the prompt just closes it. Since the goal was to use a buffer overflow I decided to just input a lot of text into the program and with a long enough input, a segfault is created. Now all we have to do is try in on the actual program. So we connect to the server provided in the task `nc buffer-overflow.ctfcompetition.com 1337`, enter `run` then enter our long string of input. After a successful crash, it prints out the flag `CTF{Why_does_cauliflower_threaten_us}`

Since there is another flag, I decided to take a look at decompiling the `bof` binary. For this I used `ghidra`. Since I don't have much experience with this, it was quite difficult to figure out everything, but after playing around with it for a while this was what I figured out. This is what I figured out about what the program looks like
```c
int main(void)
{
  sighandler_t prevHandler;
  int returnVal;
  byte buffer[260];

  prevHandler = signal(SIGSEGV, segfault_handler);
  if (prevHandler == -1) {
    printf("An error occurred setting a signal handler.");
    returnVal = -1;
  } else {
    puts("Cauliflower systems never crash >>");
    scanf("%s", &buffer);
    returnVal = 0;
  }
  return returnVal;
}

void segfault_handler(void)
{
  printf("segfault detected! ***CRASH***");
  print_file("flag0");
  exit(0);
}

void print_file(char *filename)
{
  int fileDescriptor;
  char buffer[4];
  int bytesRead;

  fileDescriptor = open(filename, O_RDONLY);
  if (fileDescriptor == -1) {
    puts("could not open flag");
    exit(1);
  }
  while ((bytesRead = read(fileDescriptor, &buffer, 1)) == 1) {
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, &buffer, 1);
  }
  close(fileDescriptor);
  return;
}
```

You can see that it does a `scanf` into a buffer of size 260. Therefore if we input something that is greater that `260 + 4 (frame pointer)` bytes, we should get a segfault because then we overwrite the return address. The `segfault-payload` file contains the data for causing a segfault.

Notice that there is no sign of the hidden flag in there. That was because ghidra removed an unreachable block. If we look at the assembly instead we can see the hidden block.
```mips

And this is the print local function
```c
void local_flag(void)
{
  print_file("flag1");
  exit(0);
}
```

To get a better picture of what is happening, I used qemu with the gdb debugger to step examine the stack frame.
```
> qemu-mipsel-static -g 5555 bof
> gdb-multiarch
> (gdb) target remote localhost:5555
```

We can then set a breakpoint after `scanf`
> (gdb) b *0x004009c4

Then print out information. Here was the information from the gdb session
```

0x7fffd8e8:     0xaaaaaaaa      0x00400840 <-- return address
```

From here I tried overwriting the return address to point to the `read_local` function. Writing to the start of the function `0x00400840` successfuly jumped to the function but when it entered the `print_file` subroutine it crashed. Still not sure about why this happens. Instead, I skipped over some of the setup in the function and jumped to the address `0x00400860` which is where the stack is being setup for the call into `print_file`. This worked as the flag `CTF{controlled_crash_causes_conditional_correspondence}` was printed out.
